# Problem Statement

A client receives nested JSON data from an external API.
The data structure is complex and not directly usable for analysis or reporting.

### Challenges:
- Nested objects and arrays
- Inconsistent fields across records
- Data not in tabular format

### Objectives:
- Parse and flatten nested JSON data
- Extract relevant fields only
- Normalize column names
- Convert JSON data into a clean CSV file

### Expected Output:
- A flat, analysis-ready CSV file
- Consistent column structure
