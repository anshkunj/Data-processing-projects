# Problem Statement

A client provided a raw sales CSV file that is not ready for analysis.

### Issues in the Dataset:
- Duplicate order records
- Missing customer names and prices
- Inconsistent date formats
- Prices stored as strings with currency symbols

### Objective:
To clean, standardize, and preprocess the dataset using Python so that it becomes analysis-ready.

### Expected Output:
- A cleaned CSV file
- Standardized date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Numeric price column
- No duplicate or invalid records
