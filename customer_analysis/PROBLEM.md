# Problem Statement

A company has raw transaction-level sales data but lacks clear insights into
customer behavior and revenue performance.

The data is stored in a CSV file and contains information about customers,
products, categories, prices, and order dates.

### Challenges:
- Data is at transaction level, not summarized
- Business users need insights, not raw rows
- Time-based and customer-based aggregation is required

### Objectives:
- Calculate total spending per customer
- Analyze monthly revenue trends
- Identify top-performing products in each category
- Detect inactive customers based on purchase history

### Expected Output:
- Multiple summarized CSV reports:
  - Customer total spend
  - Monthly revenue
  - Top products by category
  - Inactive customers list
